VLBI telescope dimensions
This file will be updated any time I have new information of radio telescope dimensions for modelling thermal expansion effects.

N.B.: From now (2019-10-30), I will move to a separate thermal expansion approach, which is a separation of the vertical movement of the VLBI reference point and any variations happening in the optics of the telescope (i.e., what happens to the delay beyond the VLBI reference point in the direction of the radio source). This means that for any telescope, for which I have information on gravitational deformations, will be exported to a separate model component, documented in a separate file).
